## Brief
This was the last project of course, we were tasked to create a full stack build with a Django back-end server that creates an API for the front-end to consume. We could choose to work solo or in a group and we had 10 days to finish the MVP we set for ourselves.    

## Concept
For our site, we wanted to create a hub where users could see a list of giveaways conducted by people like influencers, learn what was the prize, how to enter the competition and when the giveaway would end. You can think of this site being similar to a site like hotukdeals.com. We wanted to have two different types of users, a verified influencer account and regular account. Each would have different levels of access to the site's features. Social interaction would take place with comments on giveaways pages and users can follow influencers and their posts.

## Approach

### Planning

#### Wire Flow
After we settled on our concept, we created a simple wire flow of how we thought the site would be used and how a user may use the site. We were able to accomplish most of what we set out to do in this flow, but we were not able to think much about stretch goals.       
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/161787358-d019bb4a-3488-4a9b-be52-5d7e17446014.png)

#### Wire Frame
We created a wire frame to help visualise the front-end. As we were using the chakra-ui library we wanted to take advantage of the built-in colour theme changing hook and several other unique features. We also wanted to be able to reuse as many components as appropriate like the dashboard and profile components would share a lot of layout traits.    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/161787474-ff808cdd-9b6b-4c40-9390-fc68d7252aa5.png)


#### Model Relationship Diagram
For the back end we used quickdatabasediagrams.com to map out the fields in each of our models and the relationships they would have with each other. This was more of a challenge for us to visualise as it was a newer system (Django/SQL) we were working with and we spent the most amount of planning time on this to get it right.

### Document Model Breakdown. 

#### User Model
The user model was the biggest model we created but was relatively easy to set and work with in the way we wanted it to function. We initially planned to have two different user models for verified and unverified users with a difference in number of fields and site interactivity. But for the time scale we had being relatively short, we went with just one model and a boolean field to determine if the user is verified or not.       
<img width="502" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/161787933-f6afea27-ba2e-4b8e-8e48-0ea56d152453.png">

#### Giveaway Model
The most complex model to work with in terms of relationship between itself and the several connections to the user model. The main feature that we did not get working dynamically as we had hoped was the watcher_list filed. We wanted a user to add the ID of a giveaway to their watch list and have the userâ€™s ID be added to that giveaway's watcher-list. In the time we had we were not able to figure out a dynamic solution instead which we had to update two models at the same time.

#### Comment Model
Relatively simple model compared to the previous two. This was a relatively fast model to put together when put against the user and giveaway model and we had very little trouble implementing it.       
<img width="423" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/161788226-5ed92a6e-6ea4-42ea-a7e3-fbec4d9d1ba9.png">

#### Region and Category Model
The simplest out of all the models, these contain basic records for our drop down select  forms. 
<img width="414" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/161788361-bfdffea4-767e-4043-8bcd-d7ef4795a64a.png">

### API-End-Points
(* secure route)

#### Giveaways
- Get all `Get /api/giveaways/` 
- Get one `Get /api/giveaways/{giveaway ID}/` 
- Post new*+ `POST /api/giveaways/`     
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159490560-8f6cc06d-e68a-4fd5-9f06-eb32d55d2aa7.png) 
- Update one*+ `PUT /api/giveaways/{giveaway ID}/`    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159490641-bedbb702-c71f-45b2-a78a-e85318c0b998.png) 
- Delete one* `DELETE /api/giveaways/{giveaway ID}/`    

For the purpose of a user being able to "watch" a giveaway, we stored the giveaway ID in the user profile in a watchlist and the user ID is stored in the giveaway record in a watcher_list field. At the time of building this project we were not able to figure out a smooth way to do this in one request. So we made an end-point for the giveaway so that the User does not need to be the owner of the giveaway to update that ID array. For ease of checking & updating the array we create an unpopulated GET endpoint to get an array of numbers and not objects.       

- Get one unpopulated giveaway `GET /api/giveaways/update/{giveaway ID}/`     
- Update giveaway* (Non-owner) `PUT /api/giveaways/update/{giveaway ID}/`

### Front-end components

#### Nav-Bar

Navbar houses 4 main sections. The brand, the text search bar, colour mode toggle and navigation link buttons. In the desktop view as seen in the image below, links to register/login will change to profile and/or dashboard and logout when the user is logged in. If the user is not verified then the dashboard link will not display. When the user types into the search bar hit search, the page will navigate to the search page and pass the search text state with it.       
 

Desktop:       
<img width="1298" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159913196-98bb7182-6718-41ec-957a-57552f3a9ebe.png">

In mobile view, nav links are moved into a drop down opened by the burger button.       

Mobile:

#### Home page

Home page in its current version houses 2 parts, the site banner and giveaway carousel. As we made the site with charak for all components, the dark mode toggle will invert all colours with their default unless specified, as the banner was imported as an image, it would not be affected when the colour changes. To get around this, I made the banner background transparent so it takes on the background colour of the page.      


Dark mode on Banner:

![Dark mode on banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159914783-97dcf0fc-5a71-48db-bfbe-b86f4de0d8d0.gif)

Carousel:

The carousel was made with a Chakra carousel prototype and is currently populated with a card map from all the records in the giveaway GET all requests. The carousel moves from either drag/swipe or the arrow buttons below. By the end of the build time, image normalisation was not fully complete and needs to be addressed as images can be uploaded in any size or ratio at this time. Some pictures bleed into the bottom of the cards in mobile view.     


![Carousel gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159914218-7b69cf6f-5dac-4441-9389-4cc0aa2def0a.gif)


#### Showcase

From the showcase, users can view all information about the giveaway. Including an end date as well as a live countdown to that end date. If the end date has passed, the countdown will switch to a 'Giveaway Ended' text. Logged in users can also add the giveaway to their watch list by hitting the button, this will automatically add the giveaway ID to their array field and add the users ID to the giveaway watching array field. The feedback is given immediately by making the GET request again and populating the watcher list. Users can also follow a verified by clicking their username (Not a clear feature in this version) as seen below. Following a user at this stage has no effect for the User but will show up for the verified user at this stage.   
    
Main:     

![Showcase top](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159915319-59b1c998-dbf9-4caf-b3de-f476e96ed78c.gif)    

Logged in users can leave comments by typing into the comment box that only appears when logged in. Otherwise site visitors will see a prompt to login instead. If the user is the owner of a comment, they will see options to either edit or delete their comment with a popover prompt.      


Comment section:      

![Comment gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159915927-b1e9d24e-2f8c-4015-bef0-1630377adac4.gif)

#### Search Page

When on the search page, it will bring up all the giveaways on the site, users will be able to sort by several methods and by category drop down. Users can also type in text into the search bar to filter down the results.     

![SearchPage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159916656-bea7c970-a8c9-4a5e-af53-09a02daaf02d.gif)

#### Dashboard page
If a verified user is logged in, they will be able to go to their dashboard. Here they can manage their giveaways and create new ones. They will also be able to see how many people are following them.      

![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159918084-23fb5a89-c78d-46ac-bfc1-8a4491cfc28c.gif)

Form Errors:

From the giveaway form, if there is missing or unvalid data in a form field, 'toast' popup errors appear to indicate to the user that there is an issue with their new or updated giveaway form.    

![Toast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159918902-3b12a220-aa9f-407f-b410-db8ead8d8c70.gif)

#### Profile Page

The profile page is built from the same components as the dashboard but currently has less features. Users can see the giveaways they are following and in the future they will also be able to update their profile details.     

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159917150-55d74e84-6eb2-4008-bc23-9ab2931da77a.png">

### Styling

For this project, we did not use any CSS files. We relied on inline styling and native chakra features. We needed to import some books in order to achieve the colour change toggle. On the index page we needed to import `ColourModeScript`


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159956709-3ecb7c7a-6965-4e9b-a94c-92ad3b6125b7.png)

The colour toggle button calls a function from the `useColorMode` hook.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159956846-9947eb93-a026-4fd6-b597-1b20230945ca.png)

We used the native colour values for the majority of the build but for certain buttons and tags, we had to create a colour variable to store the colour for light and dark mode for the system to toggle between.     

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94964514/159956943-11d5b054-ad25-4f62-bd54-7e718629eda2.png)

## Challenges

- This was my first time using Chakra UI in a build, it took some time to learn its component structure and we also chose not to use any CSS/SASS. I needed to learn more inline styling syntax to get it the way we wanted it to look.

- This was our first back-end database built in Django python, there was a steep learning curve for us to get all the components (Models, serializers, views, urls etc.) learnt and working. Model relationships between user and giveaway many to many fields where not as dynamic as we had hoped it would be and we want to go back to improve this.

## Future Improvements / Changes

- Re-work the relationship with the user model field 'watchlist' and giveaways 'Watching_list' to make the exchange of ID more dynamic rather than having to separate API requests and have one instead.

- Add state of giveaways when the time has expired, visually show that it is finished and place them in another section on search results and dashboard/profile pages.

- Like and reply system to comments. They have been built into the models but not implemented due to time and key targets during build time.

- Homepage carousel images need standardisation in size and ratio.

- Homepage banner does not look good in light mode, so I would scrap and build it in Chakra.


## Main Takeaways

- This was the last project and I really felt that it was the culmination of what I had learnt. I realised I had to ask for less help and was able to self teach / learn from documentation a lot more. I feel far more confident being able to go on by myself and grow my skills.

- Working with a partner is great to be able to bounce off ideas and work through bugs, but I need to create more projects by myself to make myself more self-reliant.

- I loved working with Chakra UI and that made me keen to try other frameworks and libraries.

- At the end of the course I know that I love developing and am excited to enter the industry.
